The 2PC protocol consists of two phases, which are as follows:
•	 In the first phase, the coordinator node asks all the transaction's participating
processes to prepare and vote to either commit or abort the transaction.
•	 In the second phase, the coordinator decides whether to commit or abort
the transaction, depending on the result of the voting in the first phase. If all
participants voted for commit, it commits the transaction; otherwise, it aborts
it. It finally notifies the result to all the participants.

Let /2PC_Transactions represent the root node to run the 2PC algorithm in
ZooKeeper. The algorithm to do so is as follows.

Let /2PC_Transactions represent the root node to run the 2PC algorithm in
ZooKeeper. The algorithm to do so is as follows.
1.	 A coordinator node creates a transaction znode, say /2PC_Transactions/
TX . We can use the leader election algorithm to elect the coordinator using
ZooKeeper. The coordinator node sets a watch on the transaction node.
2.	 Another persistent znode, tx_result , is created under /2PC_Transactions/
TX by the coordinator to post the result of the protocol, commit, or abort, and
any additional outcomes of the transactions.
3.	 Each participating client node sets a watch on the /2PC_Transactions as
well as /2PC_Transactions/TX/tx_result znode paths.
4.	 When the coordinator node creates the transaction znode, it notifies the
participating client nodes that the coordinator node is requesting for voting
on the transaction.
5.	 The participants then create an ephemeral child znode in the /2PC_
Transactions/TX path, with their own identifier (say hostnames) and vote
for commit or abort by writing to the data field of their specific znodes.
6.	 The coordinator is notified of the creation of all the child znodes, and when
the number of child znodes in /2PC_Transactions/TX equals the number
of participants, it checks the votes of all the participants by reading the
participants' znodes.
7.	 If all the participants voted for commit, the coordinator commits the
transaction; otherwise, it aborts it. Subsequently, it posts the result of the
transaction by writing to the /2PC_Transactions/TX/tx_result znode.
8.	 The participant znodes get to know the outcome of the transaction when it
gets a notification of NodeDataChanged for /2PC_Transactions/TX/tx_
result
